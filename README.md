# MotoMatrix - Simulated Fleet Management System 🚛📍

MotoMatrix is a frontend-only fleet management platform designed to simulate real-world logistics operations for businesses. It provides tools to manage vehicles, monitor (simulated) real-time locations, schedule maintenance, track driver performance, and optimize routes — all with a clean, responsive UI.

> 🔧 **Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**  
> 🧪 No backend — all data interactions are simulated via Local Storage.
